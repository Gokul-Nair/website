I started a re-write on Dhvani architecture, keeping the algorithm same. This is based on [Kiss][1] principle. Instead of client server architecture a single executable is my plan. This will help me to integrate it with KTTS, kate etc. Now I know how to integrate Dhvani with KTTS.

Studied autoconf and automake for this&#8230;

More and more items in my TODO list&#8230;
