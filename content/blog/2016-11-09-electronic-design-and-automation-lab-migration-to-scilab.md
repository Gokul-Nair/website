The third semester B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering programme of [Kerala Technological University (KTU)][1] has a lab course on electronic design and automation. The course aims to introduce the students to various electronic design and simulation tools like SPICE, MATLAB and HDL.

I had [proposed the migration][2] of the MATLAB section of this lab course to [SCILAB][3], a popular open source alternative to MATLAB. The migration is now complete with support from [FOSSEE][4] . The source code of the experiments are now available [here][5]. A detailed lab manual will be made available soon.
