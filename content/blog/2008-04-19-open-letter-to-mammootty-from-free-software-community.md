Microsoft will be signing up Malayalam movie star Mammootty as one of the brand ambassadors for the Computer Literacy programme that is to be organized soon in Kerala. FOSS community writes an open letter to Mammootty to Reconsider Promotion of Microsoft and their Proprietary Softwares.

It is available here: [An open letter to Mammootty][1]. I request all to endorse Open letter to Mammooty by adding your name there.

A nice post on ILUG-TVM on the issue:  [Another of M$&#8217;s dirty tactics][2]
