Today, July 23 marks one year anniversary of [Manjari font release][1].

Out of all my projects, this is the project that gave me highest satisfaction. I see people using it in social media every day for memes, banners, notices. I have seen the font used for Government publishings, notices, reports. I have seen wedding invitations, book covers, Movie titles with Manjari font. I am so happy that Malayalam speakers loved it.

Kavya and me are working on new version of Manjari with more glyphs to support latest Unicode, and optimize some of the ligature rules. The latest version of the font is always available at <https://smc.org.in/fonts>
