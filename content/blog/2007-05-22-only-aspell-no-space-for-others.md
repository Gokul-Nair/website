It seems that our work on our own spell checker doesnot have any importance other than learning. Aspell is light years ahead of us.There are ispell, myspell also. But we learned a lot about the approximate string comparison, fast search on a big wordlist, candidate list generation etc.. Gora Mohanty gave valuable insights to me on Aspell and how to create the Aspell word list for Malayalam.But still problems on compound words of malayalam.. &#8220;Sandhi & Samasam&#8221; and the infinite number of words that can be created by that in malayalam is a big hurdle for us..

Can we create a dictionary with all those words?

Can we code that large set of rules?!!

Wait and See ðŸ˜‰
