[<img class="alignright" src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1463820774l/30244505.jpg" width="308" height="475" />][1]Fear &#8211; That would be the single word I can use to describe my feeling after reading [the book][1]. My belief in Indian judicial and paraliamentary system is not a firm one. This book shakes it badly. I am nobody to judge the facts revealed in the book, but what make me afraid is there is very less chance that these facts are verified by the current Indian political and legal system.

Lot of respect for [the author][2] and her courage for this work.
