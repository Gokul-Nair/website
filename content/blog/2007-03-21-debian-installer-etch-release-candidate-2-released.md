The Debian Installer team is proud to announce the second release

candidate (RC2) of the installer for Debian GNU/Linux Etch. Unless

release critical issues are discovered, this will be the version of

the installer that will be included in the release of Etch.

There are no real major changes in this release, but we have been able

to use the time since RC1 to fix quite a few important and minor

issues.

&#8230;

* The following additional languages are now supported: Belarusian,

Kurdish; and only in the graphical installer: Georgian, Malayalam.
