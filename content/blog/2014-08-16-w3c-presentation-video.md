Best Practices on the Design of Translation- Pau Giner, David Chan and Santhosh Thottingal.

Abstract:Â Wikipedia is one of the most multilingual projects on the web today. In order to provide access to knowledge to everyone, Wikipedia is available in more than 280 languages. However, the coverage of topics and detail varies from language to language. The Language Engineering team from the Wikimedia Foundation is building open source tools to facilitate the translation of content when creating new articles to facilitate the diffusion of quality content across languages. The translation process in Wikipedia presents many different challenges. Translation tools are aimed at making the translation processes more fluent by integrating different tools such as translation services, dictionaries, and information from semantic databases as Wikidata.org. In addition to the technical challenges, ensuring content quality is one of the most important aspects considered during the design of the tool since any translation that does not read natural is not acceptable for a community focused on content quality. This talk will cover the design (from both technical and user experience perspectives) of the translation tools, and their expected impact on Wikipedia and the Web as a whole.
