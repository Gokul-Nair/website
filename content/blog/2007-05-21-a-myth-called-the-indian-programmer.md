&#8220;Most software professionals in India are not programmers, they are mere coders,&#8221;

I completely agree with this article. We should make ourself different from others.

Software engineers are becoming dump users. Assemblers of pieces of code that even high school students can do. Are we using anything that we studied in our Computer Science courses in the engineering college?

Are we showing any creativity in this field? (There are exemptions, I agree, but in general)
