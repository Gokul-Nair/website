We just formed Indic Regional Language group for Openoffice. This is as per the [Openoffice Native Language Consortium Plans][1]. The objectives of such groups can be read from [here][2]. Basically the group is meant for better coordination among Indic languages to make Openoffice experience in our language better.

The announcement of this group is [here][3]

Thanks to [Charles-H. Schulz][4], we got a mailing list [indic@native-lang.openoffice.org][5]. To subscribe login to http://native-lang.openoffice.org

We just started, and I will soon setup a wiki page there. To start with , I will collect the list of issues pending for Indian languages from people from various languages and will find out people from various languages as point of contacts. Feel free to contact me for anything related to Openoffice in your language.

**Update: June 3, 2009**: [This is our wiki page][6]
