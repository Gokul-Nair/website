I will be speaking at the [upcoming W3C workshop at Madrid][1]. The workshop is onÂ 7-8 May 2014 and the theme is &#8220;New Horizons for the Multilingual Web&#8221;.

I will be co-presenting with Pau Giner, David Chan from Wikimedia Foundation Language engineering team on best practices of translation at wikipedia. It will cover the design (from both technical and user experience perspectives) of the translation tools, and their expected impact on Wikipedia and the Web as a whole.
