My proposal for migrating basic electronic circuit simulation lab to the FOSS tool eSim has been approved. The source code and documentation of experiments can now be downloaded from [here][1].

[eSim][2] is an open source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design. eSim is developed by <a href="http://fossee.in" target="_blank">FOSSEE</a> (Free and Open Source Software for Education) â€“ an initiative of <a href="http://mhrd.gov.in/" target="_blank">MHRD,</a> Govt. of India. FOSSEE promotes the migration of labs in educational institutions from proprietary tools to FOSS only ones through [lab migration projects][3].

I am really happy to have become a part of this project. You can read my previous post on eSim usage [here][4].
