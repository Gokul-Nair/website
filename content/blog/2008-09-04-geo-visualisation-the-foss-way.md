My friend Jaisen Nedumpala has been developing a Geo-visualisation system for [Cheruvannoor Grama Panchayath(Page in ml_IN)][1] of Kerala. The system, developed using FOSS tools is available [here][2]

> &#8220;Development of effective geo-visualisation based decision support system (DSS) involved primarily data compilation from collateral sources, setting up appropriate hardware configuration, design of database and design of a spatial DSS. &#8221;

Jaisen used softwares like GRASS, UMN MapServer and ka-Map. He has written a detailed [documentation(English)][3] on how he developed this and what are all the tools used.
