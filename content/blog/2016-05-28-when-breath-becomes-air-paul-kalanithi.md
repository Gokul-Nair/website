I read this book after my friends recommended it and wrote the following note at [Goodreads][1]

[<img class="alignright" src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1463936399l/25614898.jpg" width="318" height="470" />][2]

I am not rating this book. Not because of the book is bad. It is well written, I read it in a single day. But just that it gave me lot of pain and I would not recommend any of my friends to go through that pain. The reading can be felt very personal, like watching a friend &#8211; the author of the book &#8211; suffering. I had friends who went through very difficult illness and no longer with us. I have close relatives who is going through similar difficult time.

That is about rating and recommendation.

But, I am thankful to my friends who introduced this book to me. Just with some 100 pages, a friend appears in my life and leaves after a very short visit. Presenting lot of perspectives about the life and its struggles. Earns respect very quickly, and earns your tears towards the last pages. I literally skipped last few pages just because I did not want to.
