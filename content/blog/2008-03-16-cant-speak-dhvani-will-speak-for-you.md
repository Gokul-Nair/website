Dhvani can help not only blind users but also dumb users. I will explain how dhvani act as your mouth using KMouth.

Kmouth is as KDE Accessibility Appllication and it act as a test to speech front end. KMouth is a program that enables persons that cannot speak to let their computers speak. It includes a history of spoken sentences from which the user can select sentences to be re-spoken. It learns the words the user wrote and have autocompletion. It also includes a phrasebook, using that you can store the commonly used phrases for quick access.

We will see how dhvani can be used with Kmouth.

open KMouth : KMenu->Utilities->Accessibility->Kmouth. Install it if not already installed

You will get configuration window and give the &#8220;Command to speak text&#8221; as dhvani %f

Done. Now you can type some text in the Kmouth and ask it speak.

To avoid typing the words that are used often, create a Phrasebook. Refer KMouth Help document for that. You can also add a wordlist so that you will get autocompletion feature while typing words. Refer Kmouth Handbook for that also. It is easy and just a matter of giving some text file to learn.

I hope it will be helpfull for the dumb users even though there are some practical problem like keeping the computer with them&#8230;

For for information about dhvani, how to install etc see the [documentation][3]
