At Wikimedia Foundation, I am working on a [project to help people translate articles][1] from one language to another. The project started in 2014 and went to production in 2015.

Over the last one year, [a total of 100,000 new artcles were created across many languages][2]. A new article get translated in every five minutes, 2000+ articles translated per week.

The 100000th Wikipedia page created with Content Translation is in Spanish, for the song ‘[Crying, Waiting, Hoping][3]’

<iframe title="The Wikipedia Content Translation Tool reaches 100,000 translations" width="739" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3btQ5fpn4sA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I designed the technical architecture and continue to be the main developer. I am so proud to be part of a project that contributed this much for free knowledge.
