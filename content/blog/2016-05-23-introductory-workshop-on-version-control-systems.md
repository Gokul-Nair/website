The IEEE student branch of College of Engineering, Chengannur is doing a commendable initiative conducting a week long student quality improvement programme. I was invited to give an introductory workshop on version control systems as part of [ISQIP][1] [2016][2].

It was a good experience to be with a group of enthusiastic youngsters. The need of version control systems and demonstration of version controlling using git was done during the workshop. The slides of presentation is [here][3].
