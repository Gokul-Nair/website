Six years back I wrote a javascript version of popular <a href="wiki.smc.org.in/Swanalekha" target="_blank">Swanalekha input method</a>. Friends were requesting web based version that they can use in Windows platforms too. Swanalekha was initially written as a SCIM input method and later m17n input method, readily available in GNU/Linux platform. I had provided a bookmarklet version too. Later Rajiv Nair and Nishan Nasir wrote <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ajcndippakfliijpojdgeconkmpfilcm" target="_blank">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/swanalekha-11203/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> extensions.

Yesterday I noticed that the updated <a href="marunadanmalayali.com" target="_blank">Marunadan Malayali news portal</a>Â using my javascript library to power Malayalam input method in their search boxes. I don&#8217;t track who else or how many use these libraries and tools. But I quickly realized how bad the code is. Or in other words, How better I can write them today. 6 years is a long span of time anyway.

So I did some cleanup and rewrite, added documentation, example and here it is: <a href="http://thottingal.in/projects/swanalekha/swanalekha-ml.html" target="_blank">http://thottingal.in/projects/swanalekha/swanalekha-ml.html</a>

Code: <a href="https://github.com/smc/input-methods/tree/master/swanalekha-js" target="_blank">https://github.com/smc/input-methods/tree/master/swanalekha-js</a>

Enjoy.
