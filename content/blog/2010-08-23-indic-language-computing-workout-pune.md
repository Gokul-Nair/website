On 22nd August, I conducted a workout session with [Praveen][1] on Indic Language Computing at Red Hat Office, Pune. The plan was to solve some of the issues in Devanagari support for the encoding converter [Payyans][2]. But most of the time was spent on Introducing the concepts of Indic language computing to participants.  [Project Silpa][3] was also introduced and demonstrated. Students from College of Engg, Pune and other colleges attended.  Red Hat sponsored the venue at their office. It was very interesting to interact with energetic and enthusiastic students.
