This post is some notes on the current state of SVG Fonts.

SVG is not a webfont format. The purpose of SVG fonts is to be embedded inside of SVG documents  (or linked to them), similar to the way you would embed standard  TrueType or OpenType fonts in a PDF.  SVG fonts are text files that contain the glyph outlines represented  as standard SVG elements and attributes, as if they were single vector  objects in the SVG image. Unlike EOT, WOFF, TTF formats , SVG is plain text uncompressed file.

Even though it is not webfont format, some browsers will accept svg in the @fontface css3 declaration.

Firefox and IE does not support SVG Fonts. Here is the bug on Mozilla bugzilla about this with a lengthy discussion &#8211;<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119490>  This is one of the reason why Firefox does not score <a title="ACID3" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid3" target="_blank">ACID3</a> test &#8211; <http://www.itcode.org/why-firefox-is-not-scoring-100-in-the-acid3-test> . Developers argue that WOFF is sufficient and SVG Fonts does not give any advantage.  Support for SVG Fonts in the web development and font communities has been declining for some time. There’s already been discussion without objection of dropping SVG fonts from the Acid3 test. The community has put forth a proposal in the SVG Working Group to give SVG Fonts optional status.

Browser Support Matrix for SVG Fonts [http://caniuse.com/][1][#feat][1][=svg-fonts][1]  IE and FF do not support it. Webkit based browsers support it &#8211; Chrome, Epiphany. For browsers not supporting svg features natively there is a flash based javascript library named svgweb <http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitations of svg fonts:</span>

  * Not all of the opentype features are available in SVG specification
  * For example Indic fonts require many opentype features for correct rendering &#8211; see opentype spec of Malayalam <http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otfntdev/malayot/shaping.aspx>
  * Even though SVG Fonts are support is available in some browsers, practically they cannot render SVG fonts for complex scripts such as Indic &#8211; Here is a sample svg file with Meera font defined in it &#8211; [http://thottingal.in/tests/svg/Meera-fontembedding.svg][2]. As you can see, rendering is wrong.
  * The main drawback to SVG fonts is there is no provision for font-hinting. The SVG standard states: _&#8220;SVG  fonts contain unhinted font outlines. Because of this, on many  implementations there will be limitations regarding the quality and  legibility of text in small font sizes. For increased quality and  legibility in small font sizes, content creators may want to use an  alternate font technology, such as fonts that ship with operating  systems or an alternate WebFont format. &#8211; [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/fonts.html&#8221;][3]_

There is an alternate proposal to use opentype features of the font and use svg just for the glyphs <https://wiki.mozilla.org/SVGOpenTypeFonts>

Fontforge can be used for creating SVG Fonts. But the created SVG font works only for simple scripts like Latin. Fails to export GPOS/GSUB tables to the SVG- bug report &#8211; [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id][4][=27964229][4] GSUB issue can be solved either by handcoding the unicode sequences for glyphs or by writing an external script. But , more important opentype features- Vowel sign(matra) reordering issues persists.

Eventhough svg fonts by defining font data inside svg itself does not seem to have much interest from developers, using webfonts inside for svg has some importance. Just like web pages, webfonts can be used to render the text inside the svg. The webfont format depends on the browser. Example: <http://thottingal.in/tests/svg/Dyuthi-Webfont.svg> (Have a look at the source code of the file)
