NotoSansMalayalam is a font released by Google internationalization team under [noto project][1]. I was checking the glyphs of Malayalam and noted a number of spurious glyphs in the font

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-449" alt="notosansml-unwantedglyphs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/notosansml-unwantedglyphs.png" width="1043" height="914" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/notosansml-unwantedglyphs.png 1043w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/notosansml-unwantedglyphs-300x262.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/03/notosansml-unwantedglyphs-1024x897.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1043px) 100vw, 1043px" />][2]

It is interesting because the font attempted to provide a minimal Malayalam font with reduced glyph set. While attempting that about 10% of the glyphs are either non-existing Malayalam glyphs(Glyphs with dot under consonants) or rarely used glyphs(Glyphs withÂ U+0D62 MALAYALAM VOWEL SIGN VOCALIC L)

Bug [filed][3]. It was learned that the last set of glyphs with dots above and below are for [Carnatic music notations][4]. They are not defined by unicode, but font used a custom way of representing them with a ligature formed by U+0307.
