[FOSS.IN 2009][1] starts on 1st December. I wanted to attend all 5 days but I have another conference on Dec 1st to 3rd at Chennai. I am attending [National Conference on ICTs for the differently- abled/under privileged communities in Education, Employment and Entrepreneurship 2009 &#8211; (NCIDEEE 2009)][2] at Loyola College, Chennai. So I will miss the first 3 days of foss.in.

We have a [workout][3] on [Project Silpa][4] during foss.in. I am also planning to have a workout with [Debayan][5] and Jinesh to get his [tesseract-indic OCR][6] work with Malayalam.

See you at foss.in!
