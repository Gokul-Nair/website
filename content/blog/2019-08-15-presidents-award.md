Happy to share the news that I am [awarded](http://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1582056) by President of India for contributions to Malayalam language.

Maharshi Badrayan Vyas Samman by the Hon. President of India is in recognition of my contributions in the field of Malayalam language. The award, instituted in 2016, is given to the substantial contributions to languages such as Sanskrit, Persian, Arabi, Pali and Classical Oriya, Classical Kannada, Classical Telugu, and Classical Malayalam. This is given to young scholars in the [age group of 30 to 45 years](https://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/advertisment/presidential_awards_en.pdf). The Presidential award carries a certificate of honor, a memento and a cash prize of â‚¹1 lakh. These awards are announced once a year on the occasion of the Indian independence day on 15th August.
