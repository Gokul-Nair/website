(Kavya&#8217;s personal website is [here][1].)

I am a teacher in the field of electronics, signal processing and digital communication.

Professionally  I am employed as Assistant Professor at [Govt. Engineering college, Sreekrishnapuram, Palakkad][2]. The everyday experience as a teacher keeps the learner in me always alive. I love to share what I learn.

I am involved in various projects on Malayalam language computing.  An attempt to analyse Malayalam text phonetically using finite state transducers can be seen [here][3].  I have had my hands wet in digital type design and open type engineering of a [couple of fonts][4] maintained by [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing.][5] 

[<img class="alignright" src="https://en.gravatar.com/userimage/54475047/73b723d192e4507e43ba34a691a463b2.jpg?size=200" width="200" height="200" />][5]I maintain a project to create lab manuals for various lab courses for Electronics and Communication Engineering. The manuals created so far are published under CC-BY-SA licence. The repository of lab manuals is open for all stakeholders to collaborate and enrich its contents. These are hosted in [github][6].

I try to engage with the world immediate to me in the possible ways to make life better for everyone around. It was a [moment of pride][7] that upon a request filed by me to the Chief Minister of Kerala, the Director of Higher Education Kerala issued a circular clarifying that there exists no regulations to insist the female teaching faculties to adhere to the dress code of saree.

In this blog [Santhosh][8] and myself write about our thoughts and passions.
