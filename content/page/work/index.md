Many friends asked me to write down about my work environment, tools or softwares I use etc. So this is an attempt for that.

## What I do

My job designation as of 2015 September is &#8216;Senior Software Engineer, Language Engineer, Wikimedia Foundation&#8217;. So that is mostly self explanatory. If not, Wikimedia Foundation operates Wikipedia, and it is present in 280+ languages. Me and my team develops tools to make that happen. I work in internationalization,  localization, input tools, fonts, language selection, translation tools, machine translation, dictionaries etc. I am full time staff and that demands 40 hours per week. I work from home. Because of my team mates works from different countries, I often have to attend meetings at night, mostly before midnight. Whatever time I have left, I use a significant portion for my pet projects. SMC is the top one in it. In recent months, most my free time goes to typeface design.

## Electricity

This might be surprising since many people take it for granted that you have electricity always. That is not completely true for me. I live in a village 40km away from nearest town. I grew up without electricity at home. My village and my home got electricity connection just before I joined for Engineering course(2001). Before that kerosene lamps served the light. Now I have electricity connection at home, but not at all reliable. Power cuts are very frequent and there were incidents where power comes back after a few days. Kerala is known for heavy rains and it contributes to this power outages. So I have 1 KW Solar power installation at home. The roof top solar system cost me ₹100000, another ₹100000 contributed by Kerala state government. This is part of state goverments program for encouraging solar systems. This is not affordable for every family, but it was worth to invest that much money in my case. So all my computers, gadgets, light, fan, television.. all electronic items under 1000W runs with solar power. So no power disruptions.

## Internet

My work(and life too, it is 2015) need good internet connection. The default option for internet at villages is BSNL Landline broadband, which they can serve upto 2MBPS speed. This works if it works. The road side cables are get cut very often. It can be people setting fire on roadside, It can be people digging roadside for posters or banners, it can be water department or road department digging. It can be people digging to bury flowers as part of witchcraft&#8230;All happened to this cables and it has countless cuts and joints before it reach my home. Every time it get cut, it takes minimum a week to get repaired by BSNL. 3G connections? no. just 2G as of now in nearest mobile towers. Luckily, with in 8KM radius, there is a BSNL wimax tower. It is wire-free and it is unknown for people to disrupt it. But 8km distance to tower means, I need a 12 meter antenna and receiver on top of that. It works and it is reliable so far. Wimax, but don&#8217;t misunderstand, 2MBPS is what it can give to you. I am happy with it(or pretend to be happy since there is no other choice)

## Hardware

My work laptop is Lenovo X1 Carbon ultrabook. It has 8GB RAM and 180GB SSD. Processor is 4 x Intel Core i7 @ 2 GHz  It is fast enough for my work. I use an external monitor too. That is an Acer LCD monitor with 1600*900 resolution. Laptop also has same resolution. I use external keyboard &#8211; Acer USB Wired Keyboard (KB36211) it is an average keyboard, but somehow I feel very comfortable with its layout. I use logitech M325 wireless mouse. I have a wacom bamboo cth301k model pad too. I use it as external touchpad and for drawing. I dont use it for typeface design, I just use mouse for typeface design &#8211; it is mostly very accurate bezier curve editing, and need mouse for precision.
